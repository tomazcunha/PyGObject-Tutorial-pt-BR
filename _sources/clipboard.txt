Clipboard
=========

:class:`Gtk.Clipboard` provides a storage area for a variety of data, including
text and images. Using a clipboard allows this data to be shared between
applications through actions such as copying, cutting, and pasting.
These actions are usually done in three ways: using keyboard shortcuts,
using a :class:`Gtk.MenuItem`, and connecting the functions to
:class:`Gtk.Button` widgets.

There are multiple clipboard selections for different purposes.
In most circumstances, the selection named ``CLIPBOARD`` is used for everyday
copying and pasting. ``PRIMARY`` is another common selection which stores text
selected by the user with the cursor.
